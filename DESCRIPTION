Package: oliveR2
Title: A library to facilitate communication with the Oliver SMS replica database 
Description: This library is designed to facilitate communication with the Oliver
    social service data collection tool.  It is a complete re-write of an earlier 
    package which was primarily geared toward generating BLOBs for use within the 
    Oliver application per se.  This package is designed to meet the needs of the 
    Oliver application, but also help analysts with more general Oliver analytic 
    activities. It also implements packrat.
